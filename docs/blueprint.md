## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 47, 100%, 50% which converts to a rich gold (#FFB300), to reflect the preciousness and sacredness of silver Murtis.
- Background color: HSL 47, 20%, 95% which converts to a very light warm gray (#F5F3EB), providing a clean and soft backdrop to accentuate the silver and gold tones.
- Accent color: HSL 17, 70%, 40% which converts to a muted reddish-orange (#B3471A) for calls to action and important highlights.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel. Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for longer text passages, where it will pair nicely with 'Playfair'.
- Visually appealing and uncluttered layout with a focus on showcasing the products. The homepage should have a prominent hero section with a compelling image and a clear call-to-action.
- Use elegant and minimalist icons representing each Murti collection and brand values. All icons will use the accent color.
- Subtle fade-in animations on product images and content sections to enhance user engagement without overwhelming the user.
